# Experimental Examples

We use these examples internally for testing and implementing the latest features. Although these examples can be used, the APIS that are being used in them are subject to change.

To use these you can run

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/tree/examples/experimental-examples/<example name>
```
