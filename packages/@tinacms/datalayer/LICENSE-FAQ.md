## Is TinaCMS Open-Source?
TinaCMS comprises several different packages. Most TinaCMS packages are open-source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/LICENSE). However, the [Tina Data Layer](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/tree/main/packages/%40tinacms/datalayer) package is licensed under a [source available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) license based on the [Fair Source License (version 0.9)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sEOCR4gvDY0tRVqhXkJMnCKaTuztHSerJnWWh6bWquM/edit#).   All TinaCMS packages can be found in the [TinaCMS monorepo](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/tree/main/packages). 

## Why did TinaCMS adopt the Apache 2.0 license for most of its packages? 

We chose the Apache 2.0 license for some of the TinaCMS packages because we want to offer them under a permissive, well-known, open-source license that includes language that protects the TinaCMS trademarks. 

## Why did TinaCMS adopt a license based on the Fair Source License for the Tina Data Layer ? 

We chose to adopt this license because we want the source code of this package to be publicly available, extensible, and modifiable while limiting some commercial activity. This allows us to provide a free-of-charge, self-hosted solution for smaller sites that are within the Use Limitations defined in the license such as those of startups, small and medium businesses, or other simple use-cases. 

## What are the use limitations under the Tina Data Layer license? 

The Tina Data Layer license limits use of the software to installations with up to 5 users, 2 roles, and 500 documents per website. 

## What happens if I exceed the limitations of the Tina Data Layer license? 

If you exceed the limitations described in the Tina Data Layer license, please [contact us](mailto:info@tina.io) and we can provide a commercial license. The pricing for a self-hosted commercial license will mirror the [Tina Cloud pricing](http://tina.io/pricing). 

## What is a “user” in the Tina Data Layer license?

A user is anyone who has access to edit content or configuration of a TinaCMS installation using the resolve function in the Tina Data Layer package, and will be a user whether or not authentication and authorization is provided by TinaCMS, Tina Cloud, or another service.

## What is a “role”? 

A role is a set of access permissions applied to one or more TinaCMS users.

## What is a “document”? 

A document is a file that contains content or configuration and is accessible using the resolve function in the Tina Data Layer package.

## What is a “website”? 

A website is a point of entry for a website visitor with a unique second-level domain and includes related development or testing domains. You may only run a single copy of the Tina Data Layer package for each website.

## Can I use the Tina Data Layer in testing and development environments?

Yes, you can use the Tina Data Layer for testing and for development purposes even for sites that exceed the Use Limitations defined in the license. 

## What happens if my use goes over the users, roles, or documents described in the Tina Data Layer license? 

If the use limitation is exceeded, then either the user or a related party (i.e. contractor, agency, consultant, etc) will need a commercial license for that installation. Note: bulk-pricing is available for organizations with many sites.  Please [contact us](mailto:info@tina.io), to learn more.

## Can I modify the code to the Tina Data Layer package?

Yes, you can modify the code to this package but you cannot change the licensing of our software. 

## Can I contribute code to the Tina Data Layer package?

Yes, you can contribute code to this package. Please see our contribution agreement, which is linked to from our [Contributing.MD](https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. You will give us the right to use all  contributed code under the Tina Data Layer license, the Apache 2.0 license, or any other license we choose. We need this freedom, or we cannot use your contributions.

## What if you decide to change the Use Limitation in the future?

If the use limitation changes in the future, those changes would not apply retroactively and any previous versions of the software will be available under its earlier limitations.
