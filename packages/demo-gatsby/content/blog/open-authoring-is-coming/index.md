TinaCMS is capable of allowing visitors to [edit a website they're browsing](https://tinacms.org/blog/introducing-visual-open-authoring) and submit changes, thanks to a GitHub flow behind the scene.

Contributing to an open-source documentation project has never been easier, TinaCMS will fork, save your changes and open a pull request for you. All you have to do is visually edit the content.
