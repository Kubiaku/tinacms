## 🧑‍🎓 TinaCMS Dev Badge

We encourage all developers to get their “TinaCMS badge” - that is, to get it up and running and complete the basics before implementing TinaCMS on a real project. This is a must to prove that you can use TinaCMS!

Here are the steps to complete your journey:

1. Join [Tina's Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) - You can leave a message on the `#introductions`, i.e.:

   > Hi, I am trying out TinaCMS with {{ TECH eg. NextJS }}
     After I have evaluated TinaCMS, I plan to use it in the {{ INDUSTRY }} industry.  
     Previous CMSs I have used include {{ FILL IN }}

2. Get TinaCMS running and deploy a site using [tina.io](https://tina.io) and [TinaCloud](https://app.tina.io/signin)
   
   Feel free to start with one of the starter templates
   This can be a personal site, or one you did for work

3. Record a [Done Video](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video/) explaining how Tina works

   What we are looking for:
   - Who you are
   - Why you are using TinaCMS
   - Something you like about TinaCMS
   - Any feedback or suggestions you have from your initial tryout
     Tip: Have each suggestion's discussion or issue open in a separate tab

4. Post the vidoe to YouTube (or other video platform) - make sure that it is public
5. (Optional) Post your video on social media (e.g., LinkedIn, Discord, X...)

6. Let us know about it! Email badge@tina.io

   Include a link to:
   - your video
   - links to your posts

7. The Tina team will review your video and issue you a LinkedIn badge (via [Credly](https://info.credly.com/))
