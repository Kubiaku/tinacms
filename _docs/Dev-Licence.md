## üßë‚Äçüéì TinaCMS Dev Licence

We encourage all developers to get their ‚ÄúTinaCMS licence‚Äù - that is, to get it up and running and complete the basics before implementing TinaCMS on a real project. However, this is a suggestion for those who wish to deepen their knowledge.  
Here are the steps to complete your journey:

1. Join [Tina's Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf) - You can leave a message on the `#introductions`, i.e.:

    > Hi, I am trying out TinaCMS with {{ TECH eg. NextJS }}.  
    > After I have evaluated TinaCMS, I plan to use it in the {{ INDUSTRY }} industry.  
    > Previous CMSs I have used include {{ FILL IN }}.

2. Create an Tina instance using the default template on [tina.io](https://tina.io) and [TinaCloud](https://app.tina.io/signin).

3. Record a [Done Video](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/record-a-quick-and-dirty-done-video/) explaining how Tina works.

    Here is a sample Done Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhVYTOKCsWI  
    ‚≠ê Feel free to mention any feedback or suggestions you have from your initial tryout.  
    Note: Each suggestion can be a separate tab opened for the GitHub issue.

4. (Optional) Post your video on social media (e.g., LinkedIn, Discord, X...) and add a link to the post in your email.

5. Email your Done Video to badge@tina.io.

6. The Tina team will review your video and issue you a LinkedIn badge (via [Credly](https://info.credly.com/)) if you'd like.
